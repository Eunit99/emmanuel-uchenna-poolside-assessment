**Prompt:** I want to implement Add "ask to skip" media segment action.

When enabled for a segment type, this action should show a message on-screen to suggest skipping the segment. This should only show up when the segment is at least 3 seconds long and the message should disappears 1 second before the segment ends or 8 seconds after it is shown. Opening/closing the playback overlay also resets that timer as the skipping functionality is not working when any other UI is open.

**GitHub Copilot:**
To implement the "ask to skip" media segment action, you need to modify the `PlaybackControllerHelper.kt` file to add the necessary logic for displaying the message and handling the timer. Additionally, you need to ensure that the message is hidden when the playback overlay is opened or closed.

Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Add a function to show the "ask to skip" message.**
2. **Add a function to hide the "ask to skip" message.**
3. **Modify the `addAskToSkipAction` function to include the new logic.**
4. **Reset the timer when the playback overlay is opened or closed.**

### Step 1: Add a function to show the "ask to skip" message

Add a function to show the "ask to skip" message in `PlaybackControllerHelper.kt`:

```kotlin
private fun PlaybackController.showAskToSkipMessage(mediaSegment: MediaSegmentDto) {
    // Show the message on-screen
    fragment?.let {
        // Assuming you have a method to show a message on the fragment
        it.showMessage("Skip this segment?")
    }

    // Schedule to hide the message 1 second before the segment ends or 8 seconds after it is shown
    val hideDelay = minOf(
        mediaSegment.end.inWholeMilliseconds - mediaSegment.start.inWholeMilliseconds - 1000,
        8000
    )

    fragment?.lifecycleScope?.launch(Dispatchers.Main) {
        delay(hideDelay)
        hideAskToSkipMessage()
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Add a function to hide the "ask to skip" message

Add a function to hide the "ask to skip" message in `PlaybackControllerHelper.kt`:

```kotlin
private fun PlaybackController.hideAskToSkipMessage() {
    fragment?.let {
        // Assuming you have a method to hide the message on the fragment
        it.hideMessage()
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Modify the `addAskToSkipAction` function

Modify the `addAskToSkipAction` function to include the new logic:

```kotlin
@OptIn(UnstableApi::class)
private fun PlaybackController.addAskToSkipAction(mediaSegment: MediaSegmentDto) {
    if (mediaSegment.end.inWholeMilliseconds - mediaSegment.start.inWholeMilliseconds < 3000) {
        // Do not show the message if the segment is less than 3 seconds long
        return
    }

    mVideoManager.mExoPlayer
        .createMessage { _, _ ->
            fragment?.askToSkip(mediaSegment.end)
            showAskToSkipMessage(mediaSegment)
        }
        // Segments at position 0 will never be hit by ExoPlayer so we need to add a minimum value
        .setPosition(mediaSegment.start.inWholeMilliseconds.coerceAtLeast(1))
        .setDeleteAfterDelivery(false)
        .send()
}
```

### Step 4: Reset the timer when the playback overlay is opened or closed

Modify the `CustomPlaybackOverlayFragment.java` to reset the timer when the playback overlay is opened or closed:

```java
@Override
public void show() {
    // Already showing!
    if (mIsVisible) return;

    binding.topPanel.startAnimation(slideDown);
    mIsVisible = true;
    binding.skipOverlay.setSkipUiEnabled(!mIsVisible && !mGuideVisible && !mPopupPanelVisible);

    // Reset the timer for "ask to skip" message
    PlaybackController playbackController = playbackControllerContainer.getValue().getPlaybackController();
    if (playbackController != null) {
        playbackController.hideAskToSkipMessage();
    }
}

@Override
public void hide() {
    // Can't hide what's already hidden
    if (!mIsVisible) return;

    mIsVisible = false;
    binding.topPanel.startAnimation(fadeOut);
    binding.skipOverlay.setSkipUiEnabled(!mIsVisible && !mGuideVisible && !mPopupPanelVisible);

    // Reset the timer for "ask to skip" message
    PlaybackController playbackController = playbackControllerContainer.getValue().getPlaybackController();
    if (playbackController != null) {
        playbackController.hideAskToSkipMessage();
    }
}
```

With these changes, the "ask to skip" message will be shown for segments that are at least 3 seconds long and will disappear 1 second before the segment ends or 8 seconds after it is shown. The timer will be reset when the playback overlay is opened or closed.
